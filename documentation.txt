Playlist App 

A user can add a song to the playlist by adding a title and a full Youtube url. If an input
field is empty or if the song already has been added to the list an error message will be shown.

The app uses LocalStorage to store the users playlist so that navigating between the pages or reloading
the browser will not empty the playlist.

The playlist is an array of song objects that are converted to html before rendered. To remove
a song the array is merely rerendered with the selected song filtered out.  

The app uses Class syntax to organise the code which is ES6 just syntax sugar for the js prototype object 
system. If the App where to grow larger a framework like React or Angular should be added for better 
scalability, performange and maintenance.

ES6 syntax that is only supported by the newest browsers. I order to work in older browsers the 
code must be compiled with Babel with a bundling tool like Webpack.
